We have seen, after many attempts to login, it tells to wait for 1hr for next try. This is called rate limiting.
In express, we can do this by following way..

    npm install express-rate-limit

In app.js, creating a global middleware function to limit the try for all endpoints which starts with "/api"

const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit);

let limiter = rateLimit({
    max: 3, --> Gives upto 3 try
    windowMs: 60*60*1000,  -->In 60 minutes
    message: "Too many requests from this IP. Please try after one hour!"
});

app.use("/api" ,limiter);

//This limiter will be applied to all those endpoints which starts with "/api".
