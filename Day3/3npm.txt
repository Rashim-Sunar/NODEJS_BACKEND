What is npm? 
--> NPM – or "Node Package Manager" – is the default package manager for 
JavaScript's runtime Node.js.

NPM consists of two main parts:

--> a CLI (command-line interface) tool for publishing and downloading packages, and
--> an online repository that hosts JavaScript packages

TYPES OF DEPENDENCIES.....
<1> REGULAR DEPENDENCIES: A package is called as a simple or regular dependency if the working
    of our application or the code which we are writing, depends on that package.
    Example: npm install express

<2> A package is called as development dependency if that package is only required for 
    the development purpose and on which, the working of our application doesn't depend.
    Example: npm install --save-dev


TYPES OF PACKAGE INSTALL...
<1> LOCAL INSTALL: The package is only availbale in that project folder, where the package 
    is installed. It cannot be used outside of that folder.

<2> GLOBAL INSTALL: The package is installed globally in the machine and can be accessed from
    folder or any project directory.
    Example: npm i -g nodemon --save-dev
