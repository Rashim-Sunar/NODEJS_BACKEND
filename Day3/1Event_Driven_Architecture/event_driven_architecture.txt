Event Driven Architecture consists of three main parts.

<1> Event Emitter
    --> Emits an named event when sth imp happens in the app. 
        For example: a request hitting the server, a file finishing to read, etc.
        Whoever resposible for these tasks are event emitters.

<2> Event Listener
    -->Wait for an event to happen and fires a callback function attach to that event listener if the event happened.
        It reacts to the emitted events by calling event handler.

<3> Event Handler
    -->The callback function is event handler.
