HTTP METHODS:
--------------
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is the standard protocol for communication 
between web clients and servers. HTTP methods are the actions that clients can request from servers,
such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, and others. Each method has a specific meaning and purpose,
and servers should respond accordingly. For example, GET is used to retrieve data from a server,
POST is used to create new data on a server, PUT is used to replace existing data on a server, and so on.

RESTful API's
----------------
REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is a set of principles and best practices for
designing web APIs. RESTful APIs are web APIs that follow the REST principles, such as using HTTP methods
to perform operations on resources, using uniform and meaningful URLs to identify resources, and using standard
formats to exchange data, such as JSON or XML. RESTful APIs aim to be simple, stateless, scalable, and consistent.

PUT VS PATCH
--------------
One of the common challenges that web developers face when working with RESTful APIs is how to update resources on a server.
There are two main HTTP methods that can be used for this purpose: PATCH and PUT. PATCH is used to apply partial updates to a
resource, meaning that only the fields that need to be changed are sent in the request body. PUT is used to replace the entire
resource with a new representation, meaning that all the fields of the resource are sent in the request body, even if they are
not modified.
